# CHOMPI — Open Source

> ### This branch adds firmware upload over USB
>
> Built on top of [sfaber's multi-firmware launcher](https://github.com/sfaber02/CHOMPI),
> which is described further down. What this branch adds:
>
> - **Install firmware over USB-MIDI.** While the picker is showing, send a
>   `.bin` into one of the 15 slots, from the browser at
>   **<https://ugrossek.github.io/CHOMPI/>** (Chrome or Edge) or with
>   `midi-send.py` on Linux. It is written to `/FIRMWARE/NN_NAME.bin` and
>   started. Sending to the same slot again replaces it.
> - **Key = slot** in the picker: `05_X.bin` is always on key 5.
> - **USB on a Mac**, also after unplugging and replugging the cable.
>
> How it works: [`firmware/chompi-launcher`](firmware/chompi-launcher/)
> (README and `PROTOCOL.md`). The web page's source is in [`docs/`](docs/).
>
> **Use at your own risk.** An unofficial, experimental hobby project,
> tested on one CHOMPI, with no warranty. On top of what sfaber lists below,
> an upload writes the firmware into `/FIRMWARE` on your SD card and replaces
> whatever is in that slot, so back up your card first.
>
> Everything below is sfaber's README, unchanged except that its download
> links point to sfaber's releases.

> ### This fork adds a multi-firmware launcher
>
> Run TAPE, TEMPO and WAVE from **one SD card**. Power on and CHOMPI lights one
> key per firmware — press a key, that firmware starts. Power cycle to come
> back to the picker.
>
> No bootloader modification, and nothing is ever written to the processor's
> internal flash. It installs like any ordinary firmware update, and swapping
> back to a stock card returns you to normal.
>
> - **[Download a ready-to-use card image](https://github.com/sfaber02/CHOMPI/releases/latest)** — unzip to a FAT32 card and go
> - [`firmware/chompi-launcher`](firmware/chompi-launcher/) — source, and how it works
>
> The three stock firmwares here are patched to keep their samples and settings
> in their own folder (`/TAPE`, `/TEMPO`, `/WAVE`) instead of the card root, so
> they can share a card. Each falls back to the root if its folder is missing,
> so the binaries still work on a stock single-firmware card.
>
> A community modification by [@sfaber02](https://github.com/sfaber02), not an
> official CHOMPI Club release. CHOMPI Club's own README is further down,
> unchanged.
>
> **Use at your own risk.** This is unofficial software provided as-is, with no
> warranty. It is built to be safe: it never writes to the processor's internal
> flash, where the bootloader lives, so it should not be able to leave your unit
> unbootable, and putting a stock card back in returns you to normal. If
> something ever does go wrong, the Daisy's USB DFU mode is in factory ROM and
> cannot be overwritten — <https://flash.daisy.audio> will recover the board.

# The launcher

Everything in this section is the fork's, not CHOMPI Club's.

| | |
|---|---|
| [`firmware/chompi-launcher`](firmware/chompi-launcher/) | The launcher itself — source, how it works, and `make-card.sh` to build a card. |
| [Releases](https://github.com/sfaber02/CHOMPI/releases/latest) | A ready-to-use card image. Unzip to a FAT32 card. |

## Card layout — this differs from CHOMPI's instructions

CHOMPI's own docs say to copy a card profile's contents to the **root** of the
card, and the firmwares shipped expecting to find everything there. **This fork
changes that**, so the three firmwares can share one card:

```
/CHOMPI.bin            the launcher -- the ONLY .bin in the root
/FIRMWARE/01_TAPE.bin  the firmwares the launcher offers, one per white key
/FIRMWARE/02_TEMPO.bin
/FIRMWARE/03_WAVE.bin
/TAPE/                 TAPE's samples, options.json, presets.json
/TEMPO/                Chromatic/ Slice/ Buffer/, options.json, presets.json
/WAVE/                 wavetables, options.json, presets.json
```

Nothing but the launcher lives in the root.

**Why.** The root was a shared *and mutable* namespace: TAPE keeps 168 samples
there and writes to it while sampling, WAVE scans it for `.wav` and preloads
the first seven it finds, and all three keep `options.json` / `presets.json`
there in incompatible formats. Put them on one card and WAVE loads TAPE's drum
hits as wavetables and comes up silent, while the settings overwrite each other
on every switch.

**How.** Each firmware calls `f_chdir()` into its own directory immediately
after mounting the card, so every relative path it opens — and writes — lands
there instead.

**Stock cards still work.** Each firmware falls back to the root if its folder
is missing, so these binaries behave exactly like the originals on a
single-firmware card. The change is additive.

**Writing your own firmware?** Do the same and it will never collide with
anything else on the card:

```c
f_chdir("/YOURFIRMWARE");
```

`firmware/chompi-launcher/make-card.sh /Volumes/YOUR_CARD` builds this layout
from the factory profiles in `firmware/card-profiles`.

## Risks, and what actually gets written

Low risk, but not zero risk — here is exactly what happens, so you can judge
for yourself.

**What gets written**

- **QSPI flash** — the bootloader installs the launcher here, the same way it
  installs any firmware you put on a card. It happens once, on the first boot
  after the `.bin` changes (the slow rainbow). The bootloader skips the write
  when what is on the card already matches what is in QSPI.
- **Your SD card** — the launcher writes `/FIRMWARE/launcher_log.txt`, and each
  firmware reads and writes its own settings inside its own folder.

**What never gets written**

- **The STM32's internal flash**, where the bootloader lives. That is the one
  thing that could genuinely brick a CHOMPI, and nothing here touches it. No
  DFU step, no chip programmer, no soldering.

**Switching firmwares does not flash anything.** Picking one copies it into RAM
and resets; QSPI keeps holding the launcher. You write to flash *less* than you
would by swapping cards.

**If something goes wrong**

1. Power cycle — you land back at the picker.
2. Put your old card in — the bootloader installs that firmware and you are
   back on stock.
3. Worst case, <https://flash.daisy.audio> over USB. The Daisy's DFU mode is in
   factory ROM and cannot be overwritten, so the board is always recoverable.

**Caveats worth knowing**

- Unofficial, as-is, no warranty. Not a CHOMPI Club release.
- It is new. It works here and on a handful of other units, but it has not seen
  a lot of hardware yet.
- Your existing cards are untouched — this is a separate card, and nothing
  migrates or modifies your current setup.
- Each firmware falls back to the card root when its folder is missing, so
  stock cards still work. But if you create an empty `/TAPE` folder, TAPE will
  look there and find nothing.

# CHOMPI Club's original README

Everything below this line is CHOMPI Club's, unchanged.

---

**CHOMPI** is a quirky chromatic sampler and tape-music instrument by
[CHOMPI Club](https://www.chompiclub.com).

This repo contains all of the production files, both hardware and firmware, that make up the CHOMPI Sampler.
