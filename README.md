# CHOMPI — Open Source

> ### This fork: TAPE with speed-independent pitch
>
> An experimental **TAPE** build where changing a voice's pitch no longer changes its
> playback speed. Details, build notes and known limits are in
> [`firmware/chompi-tape`](firmware/chompi-tape/#pitch-shift-experiment-this-fork).
>
> **[Download the firmware](../../releases/latest)** — a ready-to-flash `.bin`, with install steps.
>
> This is not an official CHOMPI Club release. Everything below is their original README.
>
> **Use at your own risk.** This is unofficial software provided as-is, with no warranty,
> and it has only been tested on one unit. It is loaded from the SD card like any firmware
> update and never touches the bootloader. If something goes wrong, put the original firmware
> back on the card, or recover the board over USB DFU: <https://flash.daisy.audio>.

**CHOMPI** is a quirky chromatic sampler and tape-music instrument by
[CHOMPI Club](https://www.chompiclub.com).

This repo contains all of the production files, both hardware and firmware, that make up the CHOMPI Sampler.

## What's here

| | |
|---|---|
| [**Firmware — Start Here**](firmware/README.md) | Quick instructions for setting up your development environment, building the firmware, and loading it onto your CHOMPI. |
| [`firmware/chompi-wave`](firmware/chompi-wave/) | **WAVE 1.0**, a wavetable synth firmware that doubles as a starting point for anyone writing their own firmware. |
| [`firmware/chompi-tempo`](firmware/chompi-tempo/) | **TEMPO 1.0**, a pattern generator firmware — the counterpart to TAPE. |
| [`firmware/chompi-tape`](firmware/chompi-tape/) | **TAPE 2.0**, the sampler firmware every CHOMPI ships with. |
| [`firmware/chompi-bootloader-v6.4-beta`](firmware/chompi-bootloader-v6.4-beta/) | This bootloader never shipped on units, but was created to improve stability of the Daisy Seed's integration with CHOMPI's hardware as well as repair edge-case issues related to bugs inherited from older versions of the Electrosmith bootloader.  |
| [`firmware/card-profiles`](firmware/card-profiles/) | The factory microSD card contents for TAPE, TEMPO and WAVE — firmware, samples and settings. |
| [`hardware/hardware-pcb`](hardware/hardware-pcb/) | Schematic, BOM, EAGLE PCB files, and the full fabrication package. |
| [`hardware/hardware-enclosure`](hardware/hardware-enclosure/) | The six pcb panel enclosure files, as well as laser cutting files for diy panels. |

Each folder contains its own README, so check those out for more details.

## What's not here

**The panel artwork.** The graphic set and CHOMPI logos have all been removed for copyright purposes. If you choose to create your own hardware, we ask that you name it something else to avoid trademark infringement.
